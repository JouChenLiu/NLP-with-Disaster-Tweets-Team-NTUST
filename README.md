## Final Team Project for AI Laboratory (KI Labor) Lecture
* Project: NLP with Disaster Tweets
* Team: NTUST
* Goal<p/>
  Build multiple models to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which are not.
* The datasets<p/>
  [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)
* Four methods<p/>
  1. XGBoost with TF-IDF
  2. LSTM with Word2Vec embeddings
  3. GRU with Word2Vec embeddings
  4. DistilBERT

* Result<p/>
  | Method|XGBoost x TF-IDF|LSTM x Word2Vec|GRU x Word2Vec|DistilBERT|
